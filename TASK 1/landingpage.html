            <h2>What is Zero Waste?</h2>
            <p>Zero waste is a philosophy that encourages the elimination of waste by redesigning resource lifecycles. It's about keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible. Here's how you can embrace zero waste living:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce: Avoid unnecessary consumption. Buy only what you need and choose items with minimal packaging.</li>
                <li>Reuse: Give new life to old items. Find creative ways to reuse things before throwing them away.</li>
                <li>Recycle: Properly dispose of recyclable waste to give it a second life.</li>
                <li>Rot: Compost food scraps and yard waste to create nutrient-rich soil.</li>
                <li>Refuse: Say no to single-use plastics and disposables. Carry your own reusable bags, water bottle, and utensils.</li>
            </ul>
